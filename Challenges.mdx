# Introduction
1. "There are at least six dsl used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?"
-> Java, C, C#, lua, Cpython, Ruby ?

2. Get a "hw" program written and running in java. Setup ide and debugger and shi
-> `cargo new crafting-interpreters`

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with poiters, define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings.
Write functions to insert, find and delete items from it. Test them
